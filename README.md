# obstacle-avoidance
Focus on finding a clear path without obsessing over the obstacles. 

I am building on the research of MIT and others to create a goal-oriented obstacle avoidance platform using inexpensive, 
off-the-shelf parts and open source software. 

This is primarily a research platform for myself to learn the capabilities and limitations of GPUs ( Jetson TX2 ) as well
as to create a platform which can autonomously reach a destination when the path forward is not previously mapped and
will contain obstacles which must be dealt with in real time.

The goal is to build a fixed-wing platform which contains the sensors and intelligence to fly itself to a destination while
avoiding obstacles along the way. 

Applications include pipeline and powerline inspections, search & rescue, farm monitoring and so on.
